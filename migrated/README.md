## Migration Approach

For each component, we:

1. Add SSR compatibility with `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks
2. Implement CSS modules for component-specific styling
3. Use dynamic imports for browser-only dependencies
4. Add proper error handling and loading states
5. Enhance responsive design for mobile/desktop

## Key Patterns Used

- Server-side rendering compatibility
- Client-side hydration
- Dynamic imports
- CSS modules
- Responsive design
- Error boundaries
- Authentication state management

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

## Notes

- The project uses CSS Modules for component-specific styles
- Global styles are defined in `styles/globals.css`
- Material-UI is used for the component library
- Redux is used for state management
- Authentication state is managed through Redux and local storage

## Migration Summary

### Progress Overview
The migration from React to Next.js is well underway, with the following accomplishments:

1. **Core Components Migrated**: 
   - Settings component with full functionality and responsive design
   - Search functionality with complete Redux integration
   - Chat interface with message display capabilities
   - Video gallery and player with responsive layouts

2. **Next.js Features Implemented**:
   - Server-Side Rendering (SSR) compatible components
   - Dynamic routing for content pages
   - CSS Modules for component styling
   - Layout patterns established

3. **Modern Web Features**:
   - Responsive design across all components
   - Improved accessibility
   - Better error handling and loading states
   - Client-side hydration patterns

### Next Steps
The following areas should be prioritized for continued migration:

1. Migrate Header and navigation components
2. Complete user authentication flow
3. Migrate remaining content type components
4. Implement optimized image loading with next/image
5. Add static generation for suitable pages

### Best Practices Established
Throughout the migration process, we have established these best practices:

- Server-side compatibility checks with `typeof window !== 'undefined'`
- Dynamic imports for browser-only dependencies
- CSS Modules for component-specific styling
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Redux state management optimized for Next.js
