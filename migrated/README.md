## Migration Notes

- The migration focuses on making the components compatible with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Next.js
- Components that use browser-only APIs have been updated with appropriate checks (`typeof window !== 'undefined'`)
- Client-side only dependencies are imported dynamically using Next.js dynamic imports
- CSS modules are used instead of regular CSS files
- Redux store has been configured for Next.js with SSR support

### Key Migration Strategies

1. **Server-Side Rendering Compatibility**:
   - Added checks for `typeof window !== 'undefined'` before accessing browser APIs
   - Used Next.js `dynamic` imports for components with browser-only dependencies
   - Implemented client-side hydration with `useEffect` and `useState(false)` patterns

2. **Improved Component Architecture**:
   - Enhanced separation of concerns
   - Added proper prop validation
   - Improved error handling with meaningful error messages

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implemented CSS modules for scoped styling
   - Added responsive design improvements
   - Reduced unnecessary re-renders with proper dependency arrays in hooks

4. **Redux Integration**:
   - Configured Redux store for Next.js with SSR support
   - Updated slices to work with SSR
   - Added proper error handling for async actions

5. **Routing Improvements**:
   - Migrated from React Router to Next.js routing
   - Used query parameters for initial state
   - Implemented dynamic routing for various content types

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server  
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

## Notes

- The project uses CSS Modules for component-specific styles
- Global styles are defined in `styles/globals.css`
- Material-UI is used for the component library
- Redux is used for state management
- Authentication state is managed through Redux and local storage

## Migration Summary

### Progress Overview
The migration from React to Next.js is well underway, with the following accomplishments:

1. **Core Components Migrated**: 
   - Settings component with full functionality and responsive design
   - Search functionality with complete Redux integration
   - Chat interface with message display capabilities
   - Video gallery and player with responsive layouts

2. **Next.js Features Implemented**:
   - Server-Side Rendering (SSR) compatible components
   - Dynamic routing for content pages
   - CSS Modules for component styling
   - Layout patterns established

3. **Modern Web Features**:
   - Responsive design across all components
   - Improved accessibility
   - Better error handling and loading states
   - Client-side hydration patterns

### Next Steps
The following areas should be prioritized for continued migration:

1. Migrate Header and navigation components
2. Complete user authentication flow
3. Migrate remaining content type components
4. Implement optimized image loading with next/image
5. Add static generation for suitable pages

### Best Practices Established
Throughout the migration process, we have established these best practices:

- Server-side compatibility checks with `typeof window !== 'undefined'`
- Dynamic imports for browser-only dependencies
- CSS Modules for component-specific styling
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Redux state management optimized for Next.js
